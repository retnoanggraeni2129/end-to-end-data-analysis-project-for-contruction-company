ðŸŸ¦ 1. Business Overview
Active order season: August and December â†’ Focus promotions and inventory during this period.
Cancellation issues: September is a critical month â†’ Investigate the causes (e.g., shipping delays or administrative errors).
Sales opportunities: Bricks and Pipes items can be increased through discounts or bundling.
Customer Retention: Strengthen relationships with major customers like PD Wacana and CV Utami (Persero) Tbk.
Potential optimization: Increase conversions from high potential spend (July & December) to actual orders.

ðŸŸ© 2. Customer Segmentation
The majority of customers still have high potential (80%), so marketing strategies can be focused on increasing conversion and retention.
The 20% of at-risk customers need attention with reactivation campaigns.
CV Utami (Persero) Tbk is the most active customer â€” a worthy role model for customer relationship strategies.
Fluctuations in recency rates indicate that the best time to increase engagement is towards the end of the year.
Use an RFM segmentation-based approach to personalize promotions and maintain the loyalty of high-value customers.

ðŸŸ¨ 3. Supplier Risk
Insight and Recommendations:
Supplier distribution is still concentrated in a few cities (Semarang & Surabaya) â€” diversification is needed to reduce supply chain risk.
The supplier with the highest transaction volume (Perum Nasiyah Hastuti Tbk) plays a crucial role and should undergo regular risk monitoring.
High-cost items (Nails, Bricks, Wood) have the potential to increase cost risk if not controlled.
Cables and Bricks have a high cancellation rate, indicating delivery problems or specification discrepancies.
A supplier performance evaluation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is needed to identify risky suppliers and establish mitigation strategies.


ðŸŸ¨ 4. Employee Performance
Insight and Recommendations:
Salary distribution is quite wide, with potential disparities between roles. It is recommended to review the performance-based compensation system and project contributions.
Project productivity declined significantly after 2021, requiring the company to re-optimize human resource capacity or expand new project lines.
Employees with high attendance rates (Ella Widodo et al.) deserve awards or incentives to maintain motivation.
Employees with high absenteeism (Usman Januar and others) need coaching, monitoring, or workload adjustments.
It is recommended to create an Employee Performance Rate Index that combines Attendance, Project Contribution, and Salary Efficiency factors to objectively assess performance.
